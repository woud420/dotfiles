" ===== Vim Configuration Structure =====
" This file defines the loading order of all vim configurations
" Order matters! Some settings depend on others being loaded first

" Essential encoding settings (must be first)
set encoding=utf-8
set fileencoding=utf-8
set termencoding=utf-8
set termguicolors

" 1. Plugins - Load all plugins first (includes plugin-specific settings)
source ~/.vim/plugins.vim

" 2. Appearance - Colors, themes, UI elements (after plugins are loaded)
source ~/.vim/settings/appearance.vim

" 3. Performance - Speed optimizations (early for best effect)
source ~/.vim/settings/performance.vim

" 4. Key mappings - Basic vim keybindings
source ~/.vim/mappings.vim

" 5. Extra keybindings - Leader key and custom bindings
source ~/.vim/settings/keybindings.vim

" 6. CoC LSP - Language server configuration (after basic settings)
source ~/.vim/settings/coc-settings.vim

" 7. FZF - Fuzzy finder configuration (after keybindings)
source ~/.vim/settings/fzf-settings.vim

" 8. General settings - Search, behavior, etc. (loaded last)
source ~/.vim/settings.vim

" Give the highlighter more time but cap per-line work
set redrawtime=10000
set synmaxcol=300          " don't try to highlight beyond column 300
syntax sync minlines=128   " don't rescan the entire file from top
